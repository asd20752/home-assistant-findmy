This code is not tested and should only be used for experimental purposes.
Loading the FindMy cache files is not inteded by Apple and might cause problems.

## Description

This python script reads the FindMy cache files and publishes the location 
data to MQTT to be used in Home Assistant. It uses auto discovery so no 
further entity configuration is needed in Home Assistant. Consult the 
documentation on how to set up an MQTT broker for Home Assistant. The script
needs to be executed on macOS with a running FindMy installation. It needs
to be executed as root and in a terminal with full disk access to be able 
to read the cache files. The script must be configured using the variables
below and the mqtt client password as environment variable.

## Supports
- Devices (iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watches, ...)
    - including family devices
- Objects (AirTags, ...)
